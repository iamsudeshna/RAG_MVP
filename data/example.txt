Ozempic (Semaglutide)
Mechanism of Action:
Ozempic is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which means it mimics the function of a natural hormone in the body called Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). This hormone is normally released in response to food intake.
The use of ozempic is to treat type-2 diabetes

What it does in the body:

Stimulates insulin secretion: Helps the pancreas release more insulin in response to high blood sugar.
Suppresses glucagon: Reduces secretion of glucagon (a hormone that increases blood sugar), especially after meals.
Slows gastric emptying: Food moves more slowly through the stomach, which helps reduce appetite and supports weight loss.
Reduces appetite: Through actions on the brain's appetite regulation centers, it helps decrease food intake.
Improves insulin sensitivity: Enhances the effectiveness of insulin in the body.
Ozempic is administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection. It was originally developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but is now also prescribed off-label for weight loss. Wegovy is the FDA-approved weight loss version of semaglutide.

Mounjaro (Tirzepatide)
The use of ozempic is to treat type-2 diabetesS
Mechanism of Action:
Mounjaro is a dual agonist, meaning it targets two hormones â€” GLP-1 (same as Ozempic) and GIP (Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide).
What it does in the body:
Stimulates insulin secretion: Both GLP-1 and GIP pathways enhance insulin release when blood glucose is elevated.
Suppresses glucagon: Like GLP-1, it reduces the secretion of glucagon after meals.
Enhances satiety: Reduces food intake by acting on brain regions that control hunger.
Improves fat metabolism: GIP receptors in fat tissue may improve how the body stores and uses fat.
Slows gastric emptying: Similar to semaglutide, it delays the movement of food through the stomach, prolonging the feeling of fullness.

Based on current data and recent earnings reports:
Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is showing faster global growth and greater market reach momentum than Ozempic. In fact, Eli Lilly recently surpassed Novo Nordisk in GLP-1 market share for the first time, reporting a 53% global GLP-1 market share, overtaking Novo.
That said, Ozempic (semaglutide) still leads in individual product sales, especially in Europe and previously in the United States, where it held a dominant position. It has been on the market longer and is widely prescribed for both Type 2 diabetes and off-label weight loss, though its growth is now slower compared to Mounjaro.

By Region:
United States: Mounjaro has made major gains and now leads the GLP-1 class, driven by both strong demand and successful launch of its weight-loss counterpart, Zepbound.
Europe: Ozempic retains a stronger presence due to earlier approvals and entrenched prescriber habits, but Lilly is catching up as Mounjaro expands.
Asia & Other Markets: Data is more limited, but both companies are investing in expanding manufacturing and regulatory approvals. Novo Nordisk historically has had a wider international footprint, but Lilly is scaling fast.

In Summary:
Ozempic has wider legacy global availability.
Mounjaro is growing faster and now has greater momentum and market share, especially in the U.S. and increasingly globally.
As of now, Mounjaro has broader market reach in growth terms, while Ozempic remains a top seller by total volume in several regions.

Mounjaro is made by Eli Lilly and Company, a U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Drug name: Mounjaro
Active ingredient: Tirzepatide
Approved for: Type 2 diabetes (and prescribed off-label for weight loss)
Weight-loss specific version: Zepbound (also made by Eli Lilly)
Eli Lilly is one of the top competitors in the GLP-1 agonist market, directly competing with Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic (semaglutide)
